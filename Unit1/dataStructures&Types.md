# Data Structures

## Definition
A **data structure** is a way of storing and organizing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

## Types of Data Structures

### 1. Linear Data Structures
Data elements are arranged **sequentially**.

**Examples:**
- Array
- Stack
- Queue
- Linked List

**Static Data Structure**
- Fixed size
- Easy to access
- Example: Array

**Dynamic Data Structure**
- Size can change at runtime
- Memory efficient
- Examples: Stack, Queue

### 2. Non-Linear Data Structures
Data elements are **not arranged sequentially**.

**Examples:**
- Tree
- Graph
